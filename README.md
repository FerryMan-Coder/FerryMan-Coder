- 👋 Hi, I’m @FerryMan-Coder
- 👀 I’m interested in developing maintainable and elegant code and learning and applying design patterns
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mainly C# and (SQL) database programming, and a bit of python, Java and JavaScript. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate yet, but give me a few months and I will be ready for it.
- 📫 Not yet quite ready...
